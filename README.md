# Rust_Mkdir

Rust Mkdir is a delightful remake of the venerable "mkdir" command, written in the expressive and robust Rust programming language. It aims to provide a modern, efficient, and user-friendly directory creation tool, inspired by the simplicity and elegance of the original.

## Features

- 📂 Intuitive Syntax: Rusty Mkdir follows a familiar syntax, allowing you to effortlessly create directories by specifying the desired path or paths.

- 🔁 Recursive Mode: Create directories and any necessary parent directories recursively with a single command.

- ℹ️ Verbose Output: Gain insights into the directory creation process through clear and informative messages.

- ⚠️ Error handling : Provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptional cases gracefully.

- 🎨 Color-coded output: Enhance readability and visual appeal by using colors to output messages.

- 🏁 Command-line flags: Support different options and flags to customize the behavior of the mkdir command.

- 🚀 Performance optimization: Optimize the implementation for efficient execution, even with large directory structures.

##Feature To Be Added
- 📚️ Documentation: Thoroughly document the code to aid maintainability and future contributions.
